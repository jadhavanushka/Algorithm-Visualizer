# Algorithm Visualizer

The Algorithm Visualizer is an interactive web application designed to help users understand and explore various algorithms and data structures through interactive visualizations and real-time simulations.
Built using React, along with FlipMove and GSAP for animations, this project aims to make learning DSA both accessible and interactive.
